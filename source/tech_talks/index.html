        <h2>FEATURED: Do This or Fail (Seriously!)</h2>
        <p>The journey to the cloud doesn't end when your workload moves. Leaving your datacenter means losing some of your levers of control. Join this session to learn the one thing you absolutely must do in order to succeed in your cloud journey and how Google's world famous SREs will partner with you to do it. Expect to be surprised!</p>
        <p>Dave Rensin is a Google SRE Director leading Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE)—a team of SREs pointed outward at customer production systems. Previously, he led Global Support for Google Cloud. As a longtime startup veteran he has lived through an improbable number of "success disasters" and pathologically weird failure modes. Ask him how to secure a handheld computer by accidentally writing software to make it catch fire, why a potato chip can is a terrible companion on a North Sea oil derrick, or about the time he told Steve Jobs that the iPhone was "destined to fail."</p>

        <h2>FEATURED: Retrospecting Retrospectives</h2>
        <p>When incidents and outages occur, we have a special opportunity to learn as much as we can about how our complex systems surprise us and fail in novel ways. Why wasn’t this caught with monitors? Should we add more alerts? How are these indicators impacting our cognitive ability to notice the signals our systems send? What practical tools are available to us so that we can make our postmortems and retrospectives more effective? Viewers will walk away with a new lens to view their meetings through, a bank of questions to draw from for their meetings, meeting facilitation tips, and further readings if they choose to explore this topic.</p>
        <p>Jessica DeVita is a recovering sysadmin who has been doing IT operations for about 17 years, 7 years in corporate IT and almost 10 in private consulting. Now as a technical evangelist at Microsoft, she’s helping operations people uplevel their technical and soft skills for devops and cloud computing. Jessica is a fan of building communities, meetups and supporting nonprofits that teach tech to women, girls and underserved communities and is a frequent speaker at conferences on topics such collaboration/workflow systems, CRM and DevOps culture and systems thinking.</p>

        <h2>FEATURED: Integrating Security</h2>
        <p>Britney will be discussing what Security means to Development and the Business.  First, we’ll talk about what areas of security are of particular interest to developers and where your security risks are.  Once we understand those factors and how the medical industry is being targeted, we’ll begin to learn the mindset required to integrate security and make it stick!</p>
        <p>Britney began the first decade of her security career in the US Army where she began leading a team of 20, and developed her career to leading over 90 team leads and traveled internationally to assess the network security of military, police, and other governmental partners. She now oversees the Information Security Department for AMC Theatres. She is responsible for the development and implementation of the global security strategy, oversees all security personnel, and ensures security concerns are addressed at the executive level.
